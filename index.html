        <h2>Beyond Her</h2>
        <p class='main-center'>Beyond Her is out to prove that winter fashion doesn't have to consist of muted tones and dull fabrics. Taking inspiration from nights under the mirror ball, the lineup includes crops, dresses and outerwear which can take you from dawn to dusk. With satin fabrics, washed knits and metallic foil detailing throughout, the result is a tactile collection which is both luxurious and playful. </p>
